# Introduction

This project is done for educational purposes and it aims to demonstrate 
the process of components development and the way each particular component is being tested.
The idea is to make out some system which is supposed to be complex and involve multiple
components made using multiple different technologies and then to see how the testing is
going to be applied.

The system under test should be a multi-component system representing different layers like:
database, http services, micro-front-end, front-end etc. Depending on the layer the different
technological stack is going to be used. Thus typical back-end services are to be written on Java,
front-end part and integration with the back-end is done by Typescript. Also, some back-end services
are to be done using Python. Some other technology is possible. Everything must be covered with 
proper levels of testing. 

The aim of the project itself is to exercise various technologies and various testing tools
under conditions very similar to real life. All the activities are to be documented and 
properly described.

Generally, chapters for different components can be read in parallel as if it is done in real life, but
it is still recommended to use the chronological order. Also, some components can be re-organised and
refactored which will be reflected in corresponding updates to the tests. All those changes will
also be documented.
